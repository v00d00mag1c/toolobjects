### Exporting

Objects with all they links can be saved to another db via [App.Storage.Movement.Save](../objects/App.Storage.Movement.Save.md)

If you need separate db in another folder, you can use [App.Storage.Movement.Export](../objects/App.Storage.Movement.Export). It gets ObjectsList in `items`, but in console it may be just a comma-separated list of ids.
