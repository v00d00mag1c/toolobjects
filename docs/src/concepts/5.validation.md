### Validation

As described, executables must get input values that should be described and converted correctly. There is [Argument](../objects/App.Objects.Argument.md), object that wraps another object and presents it as a possible argument value.

### Usage in executables

Arguments used in [Executables](../objects/App.Objects.Executable.md). They are passed in classmethod `_arguments` function that must return ArgumentDict. As in submodules, the arguments joins from the all inherited classes. 

ArgumentDict goes to `ArgumentValues` to `_implementation` function in `i` argument.
