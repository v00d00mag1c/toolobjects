### Namespaces

We need to know in advance available objects in the app, beginning from that we need to get object to execute by passed name. The files with objects are indexed at the app's boot in Namespaces.

[Namespace](../objects/App.Objects.Index.Namespaces.Namespace.md) should have name and dir where it will find files. By default, there is `common` namespace that contains the app's objects.
