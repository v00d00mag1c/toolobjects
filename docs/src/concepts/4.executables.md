### Executables

Executables are objects that does something, returning and receiving values. 

Every Executable must has entry point - `_implementation(i)`. To execute it inside code, there is `execute()` method that should be always await'ed. It can get a dict with values as arguments that will be validated into the correct values, and the validated values will be passed as `i` to `_implementation()`. The correct values are described in class's `_arguments()` function. The script functions are black box for the user, but it can show messages via [logger](9.logger.md).

### Types

By usage purpose, Executables are divided into the following types:

|name|description|
|--|--|
|[Act](../objects/App.Objects.Act.md)|Just an alias; its purpose is to do something and return something or nothing|
|[Test](../objects/App.Objects.Test.md)|Also as the Act, but the purpose is to test something|
|[Extractor](../objects/App.Objects.Extractor.md)|Executable that returns object|
|[Wheel](../objects/App.Objects.Wheel.md)|Fork between some other Executables|
|[Client](../objects/App.Objects.Client.md)|Wheel that supposed to be client of something (not the app)|
|[View](../objects/App.Objects.View.md)|Client of the application itself, it's implementation somewhere|

### Running

Executable can be called not only from code, but also from outside. The "outside" is the [View](../objects/App.Objects.View.md)s. Usually a name of object to run is passed in `i` argument. It goes through [DefaultExecutorWheel](../objects/App.Objects.Operations.DefaultExecutorWheel.md) which finds executable by name, runs it and saves results if it passed. The executable results must returned in some of the App.Objects.Responses.* objects.

Executable that started not from code runs in separate [thread](../objects/App.Objects.Threads.ExecutionThread).
